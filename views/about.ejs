   <h1 class="text-tech-three">Programming Experience:</h1>
   <p class="text-tech-one" >
   There's a general perception on the concept of programming and programming language. In reality it has been and
   no doubt when  people say! "programming is supper hard", of-course that could be an interesting fact,
   but despite its difficulties, it seems we are daily waked with new technologies and whole bunch of functionalities ranging from internet
   facilities, new  search engines, new user experience etc.
   when we are new/young, programming seems hard and undesirable, but when we grow older, it seems easier and this could be
   applicabe to other career and or profession(s).
   My programming experience  started early 2019; as a result of my interest to understand more about the concept of
   world wide web(www). But it seemed confusing, most especially while trying to manipulate
   the web and develop a content, but the whole thing seemed to be a parable.
   Initially I had believed that displaying a content into a browser window was simply copying and pasting items from Microsoft Office to browser window or any were at all,
   and or using a template to manipulate the web. However my efforts were all repreesed, and became more confused and  thought on how
   possible to have a page display on a website and people will see it just as you do right now, but this could not work until I enrolled for a special training on information Technology at <a href="https://panafricaninstitute.org/">Pan African Institute</a>.
   However, during my registration I was asked to complete a form describing  program to chose, unfortunately it was difficult to complete the form, probably the difference between
   information technology and programming. However, after registration, I recieved a mail, stated that I have been admitted into Information Technology, Networking department precisely.
   I became excited but the sad news was that at the end of the course I was unable to write code to manipulate the computer, rather what I could do was just  to Sub-net IP Address, configure routers, servers, and switches, as well as
   using (PING, DoS, IcMPflood, SYNflood DHCP), to indentify network connections. All these were quite interesting, but still yet  were'nt  satisfied, although I was able
   to get a job as system administrator but I wanted to manipulate the computer.
   2020 ended my bad experience, I was introduced  into programming  by  <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/">Udemy,App Brewery, London</a>. And has been  exposed into front-end developement that comprises  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Bootstrap,
   jQuery and React.js and Back-end development with Node.js, as well as SQL and  NoSQL Database management, specifically familiar with MongoDB and Oracle Database.
   By the end of 2024, I will be certified by <a href="https://365datascience.com/">365Data Science</a> on Python and UIX UI as I have already completed the basics and enrolled to the advanced level.
