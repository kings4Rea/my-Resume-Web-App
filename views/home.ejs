     <h1 class="backend">Node Js</h1>
     <p class="backend">
       Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment and library that is used for running web applications outside the client’s browser.
       It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking,
       event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services,
       but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.
       Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.js is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
       My experience has been using Node.js  to develope backend functionalties and explore different types of APIs as well as  creating a RESTful APIs that could trigger greater functionalities in  web Apps, Games,  Database etc.

     <p class="backend">
       MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program.
        NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases.
         NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data.
          MongoDB is a tool   that can manage document-oriented information,
          store or retrieve information. My experience has been to create a database  using
          Mongoose as well as  mongodb cloud deployment.
